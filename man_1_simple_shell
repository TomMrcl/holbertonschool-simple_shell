.SH NAME
simple_shell \- minimalist UNIX command line interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B simple_shell

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B simple_shell
is a basic UNIX command line interpreter written in C.
It executes commands read from standard input and behaves similarly
to
.B /bin/sh
for simple use cases.

The shell supports both interactive and non-interactive modes.
It executes commands using absolute paths, relative paths,
or by searching in the PATH environment variable.

.SH MODES
.TP
.B Interactive mode
When launched without input redirection, the shell displays a prompt
and waits for user commands.
.PP
Example:
.RS
./simple_shell
.RE

.TP
.B Non-interactive mode
When input is provided through a pipe or file, the shell reads commands
from standard input and executes them without displaying a prompt.
.PP
Example:
.RS
echo "ls -l" | ./simple_shell
.RE

.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
.TP
.B exit
Exit the shell.

.TP
.B env
Print the current environment variables.

.SH PATH RESOLUTION
If a command does not contain a slash (\fB/\fR), the shell searches for
the executable in the directories listed in the PATH environment variable.

If PATH is empty or not set, only absolute and relative paths can be executed.

.SH ERROR HANDLING
If a command cannot be found or executed, an error message similar to
.B /bin/sh
is displayed.

The shell does not call
.B fork
when a command does not exist.

.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
.B 0
Successful execution.

.TP
.B 127
Command not found.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The shell uses the following environment variables:
.TP
.B PATH
List of directories used to search for executable commands.

.SH EXAMPLES
Execute a command:
.RS
ls -l /tmp
.RE

Print environment variables:
.RS
env
.RE

Exit the shell:
.RS
exit
.RE
